# Laravel Solr Integration
This is a Laravel scout driver for Solr search engine, so that you can search Eloquent models through Solr, just in the same way explained in [Laravel Scout documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/scout) for any other Scout engine.

Besides the capability to interact with Solr outside of Laravel Scout scope if needed e.g. working with entities that are not stored in database and have no Eloquent models representing them.

## IMPORTANT
This package is still "Work In Progress" nevertheless, if you have a suggestion or have found a problem don't hesitate to contact me at [mo7y.66@gmail.com](mailto:mo7y.66@gmail.com) or open an issue.
